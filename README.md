# EcoGes

This project aims to develop a new system for the electricity provider, Ecoges, which allows clients to monitor the energy cost of household appliances and the energy production of solar panels. The system is also used to calculate the monthly invoices for consumed energy and taxes and manage the energy plan (flat or bi-hourly rate).

The EcoGes application concerns a five-tier system:
- A **public website** for clients to access and update their information.
- A **client** that can access EcoGes through a public website to access and update their personal information, add new appliances and solar panels, and access energy consumption, production, and invoices.
- A **backoffice** in the **internal machine** where employees of can manage the system according to their role in the company: account manager or energy manager.
- A Role-Based Access Control entity (**RBAC**) in the **internal machine** that receives requests from the backoffice regarding employees’ accesses according to their role.
- An **admin machine** where employees can access the back office.
- A **database** to store information regarding clients and internal data.

| # Interface | Subnet | Adapter | Adapter Attached To | Adapter Name |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|

For each machine, run the following commands:

    cd ecoges/scripts
    sudo chmod 777 <script>.sh


> **TIP: If the script does not run as expected, convert the file to unix format using the `dos2unix` tool and run the script again**
>
>    \> **`dos2unix <script>.sh`**


Firewall machine:
    
    sudo ./firewall.sh

Webserver machine:

    sudo ./webserver.sh

Internal machine (backoffice and RBAC) machine:

    sudo ./backoffice.sh

Database machine:

    sudo ./db.sh

Admin machine:

    sudo ./admin-terminal.sh

# Generate Certificates

Before deploying all machines, you need to generate the certificates that will be used for TLS connections and the departments.

For the TLS, both webserver, backoffice and database ceritificates need to be issued to their IP address.

Change the field `IP.1` in `ecoges/scripts/webserver-domains.ext` to the corresponding IP address (e.g. Firewall public IP `10.0.2.10`) and `IP.2` to its own address `192.168.0.2`
 
    IP.1 = 10.0.2.10
    IP.2 = 192.168.0.2

Change the field `IP.1` in `ecoges/scripts/backoffice-domains.ext` to the corresponding IP address (e.g. `192.168.2.2`)

    IP.1 = 192.168.2.2

Change the field `IP.1` in `ecoges/scripts/database-domains.ext` to the corresponding IP address (e.g. `192.168.1.2`)

    IP.1 = 192.168.1.2

To generate the certificates, simply run the script:

> **TIP: If the script does not run as expected, convert the file to unix format using the `dos2unix` tool and run the script again**
>
>    \> **`dos2unix generateCertificates.sh`**

    cd ecoges/scripts
    ./generateCertificates.sh

# Set Up Database

    cd ecoges/scripts

Add `clientdb` schema and configure privileges (if needed, change the host IPs inside the file)

    sudo mysql
        source createdb.sql

Change `bind-address` field to desired `<databaseHost>` of database (e.g. `192.168.1.2`):

    exit
    sudo vim /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf
        bind-address = 192.168.1.2

Append the following content to `/etc/mysql/my.cnf` file:

    sudo vim /etc/mysql/my.cnf
        [mysqld]
        ssl=1
        ssl-cipher=DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA
        ssl-ca=/etc/mysql/databaseTLS/ca.crt
        ssl-cert=/etc/mysql/databaseTLS/database.crt
        ssl-key=/etc/mysql/databaseTLS/database.key

Verify if everything is ok, having the following field values: `have_openssl` = `YES`:

    sudo service mysql restart
    sudo mysql
        show variables like '%ssl%';
    exit


# Run JUnit Tests

To run JUnit tests, make sure the database server is running on **localhost** and servers are able to open a connection with it:

    cd ecoges
    mvn test

# Compile and Run

For each machine, compile and run the project:

    cd ecoges
    mvn clean compile install -DskipTests

## Alternative 1

To simplify the task, we created a script that runs each module automatically.

Run each module for each machine by providing the following possible values to `<module>` field: **webserver**, **backoffice**, **rbac**, **client** or **admin**. If desired, modules can be run on localhost by setting the development environment `-dev` before specifying the module.

    cd ecoges
    sudo chmod 777 run.sh
    ./run.sh <module>

## Alternative 2

To run each machine, you can simply provide the maven commands manually and provide any desired arguments.

Run **webserver**:

    cd ecoges/webserver
    mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="<serverPort> <databaseHost> <databasePort>"

Run **backoffice**:

    cd ecoges/backoffice
    mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="<serverPort> <databaseHost> <databasePort> <rbacHost> <rbacPort>"

Run **rbac**:

    cd ecoges/rbac
    mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="<serverPort>"

Run **client**:

    cd ecoges/client
    mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="<publicWebserverHost> <serverPort>"

Run **admin**:

    cd ecoges/admin
    mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="<serverHost> <serverPort>"
